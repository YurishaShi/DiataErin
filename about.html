                    <p>
                        I'm <span class="name">Erin</span>, a 19-year-old with a passion for gaming and technology. I specialize in FPS and horror game development, using PHP, Java, and C++. Beyond coding, I express my creativity through traditional drawing and writing engaging stories. Music is my muse, whether I'm singing, playing instruments, or using it to enhance focus during coding sessions. In my youth, I trained in taekwondo, and I'm planning to resume training, blending discipline and physical fitness with my pursuits. Active in school communities, I've held roles in student affairs, student councils, and bands, developing leadership and teamwork skills along the way.
